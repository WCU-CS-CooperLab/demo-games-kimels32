  -Use arrow keys to move Player (Frog).  
  -Avoid Red Slime enemies.  
  -Eat Flies to gain points. 1 Point per fly.  
  -Eat Mantis to gain points. 5 Points per mantis.  
  -Collect Clock Powerup to add 5 seconds to timer.  
  -Frogs stomach is not infinite! Frog increases in size every level.  
  
# RESULTS OF PLAYTESTING  
Found through playtesting that having time gained after each level made it too easy to play an infinite game. I thought that balancing the time more could make it more fun and challenging. So I just had a Time Powerup that gave the player 5 more seconds and made it difficult to achieve. I thought that if there was an 
oppurtunity for the player to gain additional points that this would also make the game more fun as well. This led me to creating the mantis powerup that gives the player 5 points. While I was able to make the game more fun there are still oppurtunities to make it more fun and also fix bugs like the red slimes spawning on top of the player.
